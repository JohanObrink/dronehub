dronehub
========

# A server for registering, controlling and following rc drones

## What's a drone?
Basically a drone is anything that is controllable via dronehub. It could be a helicopter, a boat, a car, a fighter jet or a coffee maker.

## What's the point?
Duh! Nothing! It's just for fun.

## How can I register my drone?
When it's done, you just create an account, add a drone, specify what kinds of data it transmits and you're done!

## Can anyone control it?
The basic idea is that your drone has a unique set of credentials which is entered into dronehub when you whish to take control. The credentials are sent to the drone and it confirms or denies access. If access is confirmed, the sockets for the drone and your controlling device are connected and your commands are transmitted.

## What's the release plan?
No idea. We aim to have our first drone up and running during the summer. By then, hopefully, dronehub will support what that drone needs.
